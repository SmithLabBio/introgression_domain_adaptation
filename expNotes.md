# exp1
Single convolutional layer

# exp2 
Three convolutional layers, 50 epochs, 0.0003 learning rate, 1500 snps

# exp3
Three convolutional layers, 20 epochs, 0.001 learning rate, 500 snps

# exp4

# exp5 
Same network as exp1, addition of finetuning, trained on ghost2 and secondary2 which approximates bears

# exp6
Same network as exp1, trained on ghost1 and secondary1, with fine tuning and ghost only training/testing added

# exp7 
Same network as 6 with ghost3 and secondaryContact3

# exp8 
Same as 7 but without variable lambda

# exp9 
Same as 7 but with 3000 snps used
