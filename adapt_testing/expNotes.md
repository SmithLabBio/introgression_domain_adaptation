# exp1
ghost/secondaryContact3
Flagel net + single 2d conv layer, 3000 snps, learning 0.00001, adaptive lambda with max of 10  
Result: good but FineTuning performs better than it should with 2d network

# exp2
same as 1 but with 1500 snps and learning rate of 0.0001
Result: good but FineTuning performs better than it should with 2d network


# exp3
same as 2 but with Megan's version of kerasSecondaryContactDataset
Result: good but FineTuning performs better than it should with 2d network

# exp4 
same as 3 but run with adapt version 0.4.2
